My name is Margaret MacLennan. I'm a professionally trained bellydancer with an ostomy resulting from inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) since 2013. Now that that's out of the way --
I've been a convention-going nerd for the past 5 years and have been working on my YouTube channel while branching out to Twitch. See the FIND ME dropdown menu to see my YouTube show schedule. Throw all that on top of 10 years of right wing extremism and a ukulele, and you get a lot of people asking me if my parents are upset with my life choices. Oh, and I work for one of the American right wing news sites.
