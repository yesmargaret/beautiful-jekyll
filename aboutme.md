My name is Margaret MacLennan. I'm a professionally trained bellydancer with an ostomy resulting from inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis) since 2013. Now that that's out of the way --
I've been a convention-going nerd for the past 5 years and have been working on my YouTube channel while branching out to Twitch. Throw all that on top of 10 years of right wing extremism and a ukulele, and you get a lot of people asking me if my parents are upset with my life choices.
